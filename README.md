# PCA on Customer Segmentation Dataset

This project is part of an individual assignment for the *Machine Learning and Neural Networks* module. The goal is to demonstrate a machine learning technique—in this case, **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**—through a tutorial-style walkthrough.

---

## 📘 Overview

This tutorial explores how PCA can be used to simplify and understand a real-world customer segmentation dataset. The dataset includes various features related to customer demographics, behaviors, and spending patterns.

By reducing the number of features using PCA, we can uncover hidden patterns in the data and visualize customer groups more clearly, while keeping most of the important information.
